# Welcome to the VOICE-CONTROLLED-HOME-AUTOMATION !

Home automation is part of "The Internet of Things," also known as IoT. The way devices and appliances can be networked together to provide us with seamless control over all aspects of your home and more.

# PARTS REQUIRED:

1. NodeMCU (you can use any other board which gives wifi functionality like wemos
2. Android Phone (To control the appliances via voice)
3. Blynk App
4. IFTTT
5. 5v Relay (I have 2 channel relay - You can use any number of relay upto which your board can give output)
6. 3.3v - 5v Breadboard powersupply 
7. 12v powersupply (Any 12v prefered more than 1A like LED Strip Driver)
8. Connecting wires, jumper wires, screw drivers.
9. LEDS, BULBS(whatever electrical appliances you may prefer)

# Flashing ESP8266 with blynk code:


Prepare your Arduino IDE according to ESP8266 boards, detailed installation instructions - "http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.0.0/doc/installing.html"

Flash "https://github.com/4vedi/VOICE-CONTROLLED-HOME-AUTOMATION/Arduino-ESP8266.ino" by editing out authentication code, Wifi SSID, password and then uploading the code 

Detailed Blynk Tutorials - "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKWBP3MdpMQFdOCQ63mhC_Q"

# Preparing Your Circuit

Keep everyting handy and follow the schematic diagram as shown below

You can edit out output pins in blynk as we are virtually writing data on blynk

Schematic is as follow
